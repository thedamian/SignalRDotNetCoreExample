# SignalR DotNetCore Example

This is an absolute, non-excused COPY of the official Signalr Dot Net Core Project from the Microsoft Docs documentation found at this url
https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/tutorials/signalr/sample

the DIFFERENCE is that you can CLONE my repo and get started without downloading the 1.9Gigs and 40,000 files that make up the rest of their samples.

Enjoy!
